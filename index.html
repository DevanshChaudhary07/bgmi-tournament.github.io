                We are excited to announce a BGMI tournament. Whether you're a solo player or part of a team, 
                you're welcome to join in on the action. Teams can consist of up to 4 players, but individuals are 
                also encouraged to participate. This is a great opportunity to showcase your skills, have fun, 
                and compete with other gamers. So gather your squad or come solo, and get ready for some intense battles!
